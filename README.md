🌐 **Live Demo:** https://hima1510.github.io/Human-Resource-Management-System/

Dayflow is a **web-based Human Resource Management System** designed to digitize and simplify core HR operations such as user authentication, role-based dashboards, and employee management.  
The system provides separate interfaces for **Admins** and **Employees**, ensuring secure and efficient HR workflows.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users register using the **Signup Page**
2. Authentication requests are handled by backend routes
3. Controllers process login/signup logic
4. Users are redirected based on their role:
   - Admin → Admin Dashboard
   - Employee → Employee Dashboard
